description: "Install the dApp SDK and build a working wallet connection in a few minutes."

This is the shortest working integration: install the SDK, initialize it, let the user
connect a wallet, read their party, and submit a transaction. It uses only the high-level
SDK. You do not need the Provider API to build a dApp.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the SDK">
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```shell
  npm install @canton-network/dapp-sdk
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn add @canton-network/dapp-sdk
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm add @canton-network/dapp-sdk
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize on app load">
Call `init()` once, early in your app's lifecycle. This registers the default wallet
adapters and silently restores a previous session **without** opening the wallet picker.

```typescript
import * as sdk from '@canton-network/dapp-sdk'

await sdk.init()
```
</Step>

<Step title="Connect a wallet">
Call `connect()` in response to a user action (for example, a "Connect wallet" button).
This opens the wallet picker and runs the authentication flow.

```typescript
async function onConnectClick() {
  const result = await sdk.connect()
  console.log('Connected:', result.isConnected)
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Read the connected party">
Once connected, read the account the user marked as primary.

```typescript
const account = await sdk.getPrimaryAccount()
console.log('Primary party:', account.partyId)
```
</Step>

<Step title="Submit a transaction">
Use `prepareExecute()` to submit Daml commands. The SDK prepares the transaction, asks
the user to approve and sign it in their wallet, and submits it to the ledger.

```typescript
const account = await sdk.getPrimaryAccount()

await sdk.prepareExecute({
  commands: [
    {
      CreateCommand: {
        templateId: '#AdminWorkflows:Canton.Internal.Ping:Ping',
        createArguments: {
          id: `ping-${Date.now()}`,
          initiator: account.partyId,
          responder: account.partyId,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

<Note>
This example uses the built-in `Ping` template to prove the round-trip works. For a real
dApp, submit commands from your own Daml package. See
[Parties & transactions](/sdks-tools/sdks/dapp-sdk/guides/parties-and-transactions) for details.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Handle disconnect">
Let the user end their session.

```typescript
async function onDisconnectClick() {
  await sdk.disconnect()
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>
