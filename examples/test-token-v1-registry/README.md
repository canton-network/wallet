# @canton-network/example-test-token-v1-registry

Example backend registry implementation for CIP-0056 token flows on Canton.

## Overall Description

This project is a reference implementation of a token registry backend for the Test Token V1 standard. It exposes registry API endpoints for:

- token metadata
- transfer instructions
- allocations
- allocation instructions

### Purpose

- provides a reusable second CIP-0056 test token backend (beyond Amulet) so application tests do not become Amulet-specific
- reduces duplication across teams by offering a shared, easy-to-deploy testing token instead of requiring each team to build a token from scratch
- modernizes and harden the earlier prototype by aligning with current Wallet SDK usage and adding verification via automated tests
- provides practical coverage of registry-facing CIP-0056 workflows to complement on-ledger-only token examples

  end

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 11.x
- dependencies installed at repository root
- local Canton/localnet setup if you want full end-to-end behavior

### Installation

From repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build only this example:

```bash
pnpm --filter @canton-network/example-test-token-v1-registry build
```

Run in development mode:

```bash
pnpm --filter @canton-network/example-test-token-v1-registry dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:5634`.

```

## Testing

Run tests:

```bash
pnpm --filter @canton-network/example-test-token-v1-registry test
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
pnpm --filter @canton-network/example-test-token-v1-registry test:coverage
```

Notes:

- tests are discovered under `src/**/*.test.ts`
- both node and browser projects are executed
- coverage thresholds are defined in `vitest.config.ts`

## Development & Contribution Guide

## @customize Flag

This example includes `@customize` comments in selected files.

What it is for:

- marks places that are intentionally project-specific
- highlights decisions made for this reference implementation that you will likely want to change in your own token backend
- acts as a migration checklist when copying this project into a new repository or package

When to look it up:

- right after copying/scaffolding this example for your own token
- before first production-like deployment
- when replacing test/demo behavior with your real business logic and infrastructure

How to use it:

1. Search the project for `@customize`.
1. Review each marked location and decide whether to keep, replace, or remove that logic.
1. Prioritize security, auth, persistence, and startup/init code paths first.

Development loop:

1. Modify API handlers and domain logic in `src/api/**`.
2. If API specs change, regenerate types:

    ```bash
    pnpm --filter @canton-network/example-test-token-v1-registry generate:types
    ```

3. Run tests and coverage.
4. Build before opening a PR.

## 8. Bug Reporting

If you find a bug:

1. Open an issue at: [canton-network/wallet issues](https://github.com/canton-network/wallet/issues)
1. Include reproduction steps, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
1. Attach logs and relevant request/response payloads when possible.

If issue templates are available in the repository, prefer using the most specific template.
