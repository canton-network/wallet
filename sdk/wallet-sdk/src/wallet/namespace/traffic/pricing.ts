/**
 * Client-side mirror of the pricing arithmetic in
 * `damljs/traffic-purchase-models/daml/Tea/TrafficPurchase.daml`.
 *
 * This exists because the registry has to be told the exact amount before the
 * ledger computes it. `TrafficPurchaser_PurchaseCredits` works out for itself
 * what the requested traffic costs and hands that figure to
 * `TransferFactory_Transfer`, whose choice context was fetched for a transfer of
 * whatever amount we asked the registry about. Disagreeing by a single unit
 * means a context fetched for a transfer the ledger will not make.
 *
 * So these functions track the model's `assetNeededFor` and `wholeBytes`
 * exactly, including the rounding *direction*: cost rounds up and traffic rounds
 * down, so a buyer never receives traffic they did not pay for.
 *
 * Amounts stay strings end to end -- `Numeric` is `@daml/types`' alias for
 * exactly that -- because a Daml `Decimal` carries up to 38 digits and a JS
 * `number` cannot hold the ones a real registry can mint. Every such string is
 * base-10 with no exponent (`'1048576'`, `'0.5'`); exponent notation is refused
 * rather than reinterpreted, since the participant rejects it too.
 *
 * The module is deliberately pure -- no SDK context -- so a malformed figure
 * leaves here as a plain `Error`. `TrafficAccountNamespace` translates those into
 * `SDKError`s, so that a caller sees one kind of failure from the namespace.
